Third Place Awardee - National Level Hackathon: Hack the Future 2025 
<br>
Organized by National Statistical Office (NSO) India in Collaboration with IIT Gandhinagar

Developed regression models to estimate Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) using India's Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (2022-23) data covering 2.6 lakh+ households and 11 lakh+ individuals. 
Integrated household and individual level data to construct a comprehensive dataset and Implemented Lasso Regression for feature selection identifying key drivers. 
Optimized Gradient Boosting model via GridSearchCV to estimate MPCE achieving the 71% of variation explained and 12.2% MAPE.
